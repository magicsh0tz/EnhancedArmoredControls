# Enhanced Armored Controls
Enhanced Armored Controls allows you to operate armored vehicles as a one-man crew without a dedicated driver.

This mod must be installed on the server and is optional for clients. Clients that do not have the mod installed will not be able to use the mod features.

It is recommended to run [CBA_A3](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=450814997) for better optimized PFHs and compatibility with modded vehicles.

1. Enter a Tank/APC as the gunner or commander.
2. Select "Take controls" in the action menu (scroll wheel) to take control of the vehicle.
3. Control the vehicle using WASD keys. (Select "Release controls" to release the controls)
